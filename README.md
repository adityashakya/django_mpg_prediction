# Mileage Prediction Django Web Application
Django Webapp for Machine Learning prediction using mpg dataset.

This project will contain the machine learning model and the web application to demonstrate working of the model. 


For developing the web application we use the django framework. 
The project also includes docker containerization of the project.

Project is inspired by the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ZJekJXGfI
However, this reopsitory contains the Neural Network implementation using Keras instead of RandomForest model of sklearn used by original author.
